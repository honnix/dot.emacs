AWK it! allows you to see AWK output as you are typing the script;
it sends selected region to awk and uses yasnippet as interactive UI.

There are 3 modes of AWK code: simplified syntax(default, see below),
single line AWK syntax (regular AWK syntax but only inside the default
match) and raw AWK syntax(full AWK code). AWK it! can transfrom code
from one mode to another(not perfect, but it will make an effort) and
there is also support for multiple lines. Data is expanded with selected
yasnippet expand keybinding.
