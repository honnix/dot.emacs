Add a new TYPE to current major mode and inform font-lock.

When preceded by C-u the display is not updated.

Return non-nil if the type was not known before.

\(fn TYPE &optional DELAY-ACTION MODE)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-define-type-in-mode "ctypes" "\
Add TYPE to major mode MODE and inform font-lock.

When preceded by C-u the display is not updated.

\(This function is designed for interactive use, please call
`ctypes-define-type' from Lisp programs.)

\(fn TYPE &optional DELAY-ACTION MODE)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-buffer "ctypes" "\
Search for types in buffer, inform font-lock if any is found.

When preceded by C-u the action is not performed.

Return non-nil if new types are found.

\(fn &optional BUF DELAY-ACTION MODE)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-all-buffers "ctypes" "\
Search for types in all buffers, inform font-lock about all discoveries.

When preceded by C-u the display is not updated.

Return non-nil if new types are found.

\(fn &optional DELAY-ACTION)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-tags "ctypes" "\
Search for types in files in the visited TAGS table.
Should no tags table be visited, the user will be prompted for a new.

When preceded by C-u the display is not updated.

Return non-nil if new types are found.

\(fn &optional DELAY-ACTION)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-dir "ctypes" "\
Search for types in files in a directory hierarchy.

See variable `ctypes-dir-read-file' for a description of which files
are opened during scanning, and how you can change the behavior.

When preceded by C-u the display is not updated.

Return non-nil if new types are found.

\(fn &optional DIR DELAY-ACTION)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-file "ctypes" "\
Search for types in file FILE.
Should FILE not be loaded it is read into a temporary buffer.

Return mode of file, if new types was found.

\(fn FILE &optional DELAY-ACTION)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-auto-parse-mode "ctypes" "\
Toggle CTypes auto parse mode; search all new buffers for types.
With arg, turn types Auto Mode on if and only if arg is positive.

This a global minor mode, it does not have a private keymap, nor does
it add itself to the mode line.

Place the following in your startup file to enable this feature in
future sessions:

    (require 'ctypes)
    (ctypes-auto-parse-mode 1)

When activated, the functions in the hook `ctypes-auto-parse-mode-hook'
is called with no args.

\(fn &optional ARG)" t nil)

(autoload 'ctypes-read-file "ctypes" "\
Load types previously saved with `ctypes-write-file'.
The name of the file is given by the optional argument FILE.
Should no file name be given the value of the variable `ctypes-file-name'
is used.

Please note that the types read will be added to the current types.

When preceded by C-u the display is not updated.

The third argument, NO-ERROR, determines whether or not we should
raise an error if there should be any problem loading the file.

Should the fourth argument, QUIETLY, be non-nil no messages are
generated when the file is loaded.

Return non-nil if new types are found.
